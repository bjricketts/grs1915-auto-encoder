# grs1915-auto-encoder
My thesis work on mapping the X-ray Varaibility patterns of the X-ray Black hole binary system GRS 1915+105. This repository only contains the projection plotter (app.py) and the UMAP co-ordinates (and associated information) in a pickle file. For the original data used in this project, please go to my website benricketts.com or send me an email/message.
